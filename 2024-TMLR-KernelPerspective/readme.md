# Publication Details

E. Gonzalez, M. Abudia, M. T. Jury, R. Kamalapurkar, and J. A. Rosenfeld [**The kernel perspective on dynamic mode decomposition,**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00106) under review at TMLR

Software: MATLAB R2020b or newer (needs the `pagemtimes` function introduced in R2020b)

External Dependencies:
1) The cylinder flow example needs [code](http://dmdbook.com/CODE.zip) and [data](http://dmdbook.com/DATA.zip) from the [DMD book by Kutz et al.](http://www.dmdbook.com/) Unzip `DATA.zip` copy the `FLUIDS` directory to the placeholder `DATA` directory of this repository. The script `Examples\CylinderFlow\cylinderFlowKoopmanDMD.m` will then reproduce the results in the paper.

Simulation code is made available as-is without any guarantees whatsoever. Every effort has been made to ensure that the code uploaded here reproduces the results presented in the linked publications; however, the authors do not make any guarantees regarding exact reproduction of the said results. If you notice any mismatch, please contact the owner of the repository.
