This is a placeholder for the datasets used for the numerical experiments in the paper.

To run the cylinder flow experiment, download the cylinder flow data from [the DMD book website](http://dmdbook.com/DATA.zip) and unzip the `FLUIDS` folder inside `DATA.zip` into this folder and then run `Examples\CylinderFlow\cylinderFlowKoopmanDMD.m`.

To run the turbulent flow experiment, download the turbulent flow data file named `7999.am` from [A Fluid Flow Data Set for Machine Learning](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000515488). Direct link to the file is [here](https://libdrive.ethz.ch/index.php/s/lv7dV40oYlkWJiC/download?path=%2F&files=7999.am). Save the file in this folder and then run `Examples\TurbulentFlow\turbulentFlowKoopmanDMD.m`.
